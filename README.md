# GPA Calculator – Multi-Page Web App 🎓

This is a GPA Calculator web project built with multiple HTML pages. It allows students to calculate their GPA based on course grades and credit hours. Developed as an academic project, it works accurately for institutions like **SRM**, **Anna University**, and **Sathyabama**.

## 🚀 How to Run

> 🔑 **Start the project by opening `DTMP1.html` in a browser.**  
All other `.html` files are supporting pages linked through navigation or internal logic.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `DTMP1.html` – Main entry point (start here)
- `dtm2.html` to `dtmp4.html` – Supporting pages for inputs, outputs, and flow
- `GPA_Calculator.pptx` – Project documentation
- `style.css`, `script.js` – (Optional, if used for design or logic)
- `assets/` – (Optional folder for images/icons)

## ✅ Tested and Working For

- SRM Institute of Science and Technology  
- Anna University  
- Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology

## ❌ Not Working For (Due to Different GPA Systems)

- KIT (Kumaraguru College of Technology)  
- VIT (Vellore Institute of Technology)  
- IIT (Indian Institutes of Technology)

> These institutions use different grade scales or weightage systems that need additional configuration in the code.

## 📊 Features

- Multi-page GPA calculation system
- Grade-to-point conversion
- Weighted GPA logic using credit hours
- Clear flow and modular design
- Potential for GUI/web expansion

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add grading logic for KIT, VIT, and IIT formats
- Merge into a single-page application (SPA) for faster navigation
- Make the tool responsive for mobile use
- Build a Python or Flask version with database integration
